This is a multithreaded algorithm that approximates pi using Monte Carlo.
It's accurate up to 4 decimal places (1e7 points iterations per thread, 16 threads) due to rounding errors and duplicate points.
The engine used for the uniform distribution is "Mersenne Twister".
Be careful when running it, as it will max out your CPU in an attempt to expedite the computation.
